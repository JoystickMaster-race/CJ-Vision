## Pre-threaded asynchronous computer vision library used for easy deployment to UNIX based coprocessors.

### CJ-Vision-2.0 in development

#### Build Status
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ConnorBuchel0890/WML/_apis/build/status/wml-frc.CJ-Vision?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ConnorBuchel0890/WML/_build/latest?definitionId=12&branchName=master)

### Features:
- Pre-threaded. (wrappers around commonly used OpenCV functions are threaded upon launch)

- Asynchronous. (aynchronous structure for threaded functions)

- UNIX based Deployment. (uses GradleRIO & GradleRIO syntax for building/deploying to UNIX based systems)

- Socket Networking. (sends CV data through custom socket programming and can be received using provided header insert)
