## Pre-threaded asynchronous computer vision library used for easy deployment to UNIX based coprocessors.

### CJ-Vision-2.0 in development


### Features:
- Pre-threaded. (wrappers around commonly used OpenCV functions are threaded upon launch)

- Asynchronous. (aynchronous structure for threaded functions)

- UNIX based Deployment. (uses GradleRIO & GradleRIO syntax for building/deploying to UNIX based systems. See below for supported devices & systems)

- Socket Networking. (sends CV data through custom socket programming and can be received using provided header insert)
