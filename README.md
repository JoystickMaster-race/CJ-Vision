## Asynchronous computer vision framework with C UDP networking for data transfer and embedded tools for easy deployment to UNIX based coprocessors.

### CJ-Vision-2.0 in development

#### Build Status
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ConnorBuchel0890/WML/_apis/build/status/wml-frc.CJ-Vision?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ConnorBuchel0890/WML/_build/latest?definitionId=12&branchName=master)

### Features:
- Complete framework, allows you to build programs on top of the framework without the need for prior programming or other frameworks. E.g, FRC timed robot skeleton.

- OpenCV embedded functions

- Allows local debugging with webcam

- Your choice in co-processor, rpi, jetson, tinkerboard etc...

- Asynchronous structure using multithreading for fast CV

- UNIX based Deployment. (uses GradleRIO/Embedded tools & GradleRIO syntax for building/deploying to UNIX based systems)

- Socket Networking. (sends CV data through custom socket programming)
